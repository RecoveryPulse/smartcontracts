# Inital Draft

Recoverable contracts with a cooldown period offer a mechanism for managing ownership transfer and recovery processes within smartcontracts.

#### Key Components

1. **Recovery Condition Contract:**
    - At the heart of this design lies the concept of a recovery condition contract. This contract defines the criteria or conditions that must be met before ownership transfer is allowed. By encapsulating recovery logic within a separate contract, the system gains flexibility and extensibility.
    - The recovery condition contract provides an interface that allows developers to implement custom recovery conditions tailored to the specific requirements of their application. This interface defines a method for assessing whether a proposed ownership transfer is permissible based on predefined criteria.

2. **Two-Step Ownership Recovery:**
    - The ownership recovery process is structured as a two-step mechanism to ensure security and mitigate the risk of unauthorized transfers. 
    - Initially, the trusted address initiates the transfer by specifying the address of the intended new owner. This action triggers the commencement of the transfer process, marking the new owner as pending.
    - The finalization of the transfer requires the new owner to accept after the recovery condition is met.

3. **Cooldown Period:**
    - A crucial feature of this contract design is the incorporation of a cooldown period following any modification to the recovery condition contract. This cooldown period serves to regulate the frequency of changes and promote system stability.
    - After the recovery condition contract is updated, a predefined cooldown period must elapse before another change can be made. This cooldown mechanism helps prevent rapid alterations.
